# Hospital-DBMS

The objective of the project was to design a Hospital DBMS, which will be able to perform some operations on the database that are common to this use case scenario. Some of the included functions are: creating patient and doctor accounts, updating/deleting/storing treatment records in the database, assigning patients to rooms for inpatient treatment etc. 

*The application was developed using Django, SQLite 3 and Python 3.10*

---

This web application can be accessed by users, who can create their profiles in the database to make appointments.
The database can be also edited by the administrator, who has full control over the application.

---

The application has several pages:
- **Home Page**: presents the information about existing departments in the hospital.
- **Departments Page**: shows details about each department
- **Doctors Page**: is used to list all the doctors working in the hospital.

Apart from that, the application also has pages related to the patient's and doctor's accounts.
- Doctors can review patients treatment records and information about inpatient treatment in their department.
- Patients can make appointments to the selected doctor and see previous visits (but not treatment records).

This application was developed as a final project for the Database Design Course at **South China University of Technology** in *December 2023*.
